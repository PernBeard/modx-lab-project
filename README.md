# modx-lab-project

A modx project involving basic use of resources, templates, chunks, and snippets. 

## Areas of Improvement

Lost some modx system settings when using Gitify to build from dev files. Look into ignoring orphaned system settings -or- use environment variables in Gitify.

Did not properly utilize the foundation 6 style settings file. This could help reduce redundancy and clean up scss files.

Mix of vanilla JS and jQuery in animation script. Either full embrace jQuery for the project or find a polyfill for animations/transitions in IE9.
